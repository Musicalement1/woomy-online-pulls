	<p class="patchnoteTitle">IMA FIRIN MAH LAZOR<span class="patchnoteTime">11/30/2025 v1.0.1</span></p>
	<ul class="patchnoteBody">
		<li>Added Lasers</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Instantly fire a beam that deals damage to some amount of entities inside of it</li>
			<li>Lasers are invincible and cannot take damage; They are not entities</li>
			<li>Test them from Testbed > Admin Testbed > Beta Tanks</li>
			<li>Currently there are no regular laser tanks</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Added Animated Lasers setting, true by default</li>
		<li>Added a Fake Aim setting</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Aimming has been changed to reflect your <i>actual</i> aim on the server by default</li>
			<li>Previously it was based off your mouse position on your device</li>
			<li>Lasers, being seperate from the player, cannot have their position update as fast casuing them to look janky</li>
			<li>In any sense, I figured this was for the better because knowing your server sided aim is probably more valuable even though the controls might appear less responsive</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Touched up main menus</li>
		<li>Reduced the resolution of most assets resulting in much faster loading times</li>
		<li>Added room settings during creation</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Max Players</li>
			<li>Bot Amount</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Bumped network protocol version because of the above change</li>
		<li>Bumped settings versions due to changes</li>
		<li>Added Vignettes</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Added Vignette strength setting</li>
			<li>Matches your simulated tank color</li>
			<li>Added "v" packet -> socket.talk("v", .1, "#FF0000FF")</li>
		</ul>
        <li>Clients now use a self hosted version of PeerJS for signaling</li>
        <ul>
            <li>v1.0.1 - Fixed CORS error stopping signaling</li>
        </ul>
		<li>Added a Performance Mode setting which sacrifices as much as possible (within reason) to increase FPS</li>
		<li>Removed Server CPU and Server Mem from the L menu because they served no purpose</li>
		<li>Added Movement Smoothing to the L menu</li>
		<li>Fixed nearestDifferentMaster (any AI mechanic) not targeting correctly in some cases</li>
		<li>Fixed the play button not working sometimes (hence the loading menu)</li>
		<li>Fixed movment smoothing in the client to work as intended</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Now it will only smooth based off how many frames can be rendered between view packets</li>
			<li>Or rather, if your internet is dog, you probably have more time to render frames than youre receiving frames, therefore it has time to be animated without affecting "actual" gameplay</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Removed DAMAGE_EFFECTS and is now true by default</li>
		<ul>
			<li>All entities now take the amount of penatration into account when calculating damage</li>
			<li>It didn't make sense for this to be selective with the only exceptions being a handful of entities (like food?)</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Removed RATIO_EFFECTS and is now false by default</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This was a special form of damage reduction only used by bosses, minibosses, dominators, and a few others</li>
			<li>This is better done by adjusting the entity's stats</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Removed MOTION_EFFECTS and is now false by default</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This was used by almost every entity was only applicable when two entities of the same team were colliding to adjust the amount of pushback when based off both penatration AND health</li>
			<li>Niche to say the least</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Added TARGET_EVERYTHING ai setting</li>
		<li>Removed skip bomb io type</li>
		<li>Removed all uses of coreSize</li>
		<li>Adjusted baller branch design</li>
		<li>Fixed there not being a 1 second cooldown between swapping tanks with Q</li>
		<li>Fixed shootOnDeath not apply skills properly, fixing explosions having infinite damage</li>
		<li>Upgrade menu color now matches simulated tank color</li>

	<ul class="patchnoteBody">
		<li>Healthbars now disappear properly</li>
		<li>Actually fixed LSD this time</li>
		<li>Added a new 1v1 gamemode</li>
		<li>Its a smaller arena with 4 rocky tiles and one nest. Theres plenty of food and obstacles so every tank should be able to perform well. The queue will try and get you a game as soon as possible, it depends on whos available in the room. When you do a match you will be teleported to a private arena where its just rocks, crashers, food, and your opponent (note however, food and crashers are shared between all arenas. You might see food suddenly die near you as a result.). The winner is decided by whoever is the last one standing so any means of execution can be used. After the match, records will be updated and the loser will have to wait in the queue for a short time before finding a match again. This means, if you win, most of the time you'll have continous gameplay. No records are saved and will be lost upon leaving the server</li>

		<li>Change how movement smoothing works</li>
		<ul>
			<li>It now only smooths for extra frames</li>

      <h3><b>Notes</b></h3>
      <li>Got a cool idea to make black and whiteholes, I forget from where but, I think it came out really way, especially the design.</li>
      <li>The whiteholes pushes away things and blackholes pull them in. In most cases whiteholes are kind of bad, but they're really good defensively because they can let you completely avoid damage.</li>
      <li>Also, thank you so much Clicks for your contribution!</li>
      <li>I tried my best to balance all the new tanks but, as always, it probably isn't perfect; Let me know in the discord if you find any bugs or unbalanced things.</li>

        <li>Added an function parameter for direct access</li>
        <li>Technically theres a "world border" now. When you travel out 107374182350 distance, theoretically your collisions should wrap around to the other side</li>

        <li>Theres a video in the discord showing an example!</li>
        <li>This is in beta right now and issues may occur. I recommend keeping the console open to see if anything goes wrong.</li>
        <li>I had to add a shabby way to detect what mockups were actually changing, but it *shouldnt* be a problem unless you're doing some really crazy stuff.</li>

        <h3><b>Main Point</b></h3>
        <li>You can create rooms for any gamemode and people can join you, these rooms run on your device -- not a server. If your device is slow or your internet is bad, it will affect everyone who joins you. This is known as a peer to peer network where all traffic goes to my glitch server and to the person hosting the game on their device, their devide does a ton of math and sends it back to the glitch server to give to all the other people connected. Everyone only talks to my server and not each other like in typical peer to peer networks which means no ip addresses are revealed.</li>
        <li>This is much cheaper, easier to maintain, and sustainable</li>
        <li>Do not expect any updates or too many bug fixes</li>
